## Machine Learning

we focus on teaching machines or computers to perform certain tasks without being given specific instructions.

Artificial intelligence is a broad field and every system that can learn and solve problems might be considered an AI. Machine learning is one specific approach to this broad field. In machine learning the AI doesn’t receive any instructions.

It’s dynamic and restructures itself.

The two main approaches are supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
Others are: reinforcement learning.

#### Supervised Learning

Here, we give our model a set of inputs and also the corresponding outputs, which are the desired results. In this way, the model learns to match certain inputs to certain outputs and it adjusts its structure. It learns to make connections between what was put in and what the desired output is. It understands the correlation. When trained well enough, we can use the model to make predictions for inputs that we don’t know the results for.

Classic supervised learning algorithms are regressions classifications and support vector machines.

#### Unsupervised Learning

With unsupervised learning on the other hand, we don’t give our model the desired results while training. Not because we don’t want to but because we don’t know them. This approach is more like a kind of pattern recognition. We give our model a set of input data and it then has to look for patterns in it.
Once the model is trained, we can put in new data and our model will need to make decisions.
Since the model doesn’t get any information about classes or results, it has to work with similarities and patterns in the data and categorize or cluster it by itself.
Classic unsupervised learning algorithms are clustering, anomaly detection and some applications of neural networks.

#### Reindforcement Learning

Here we create some model with a random structure. Then we just observe what it does and reinforce or encourage it, when we like what it does. Otherwise, we can also give some negative feedback. The more our model does what we want it to do, the more we reinforce it and the more “rewards” it gets. This might happen in form of a number or a grade, which represents the so-called fitness of the model. 
In this way, our model learns what is right and what is wrong. You can imagine it a little bit like natural selection and survival of the fittest. We can create 100 random models and kill the 50 models that perform worst. Then the remaining 50 reproduce and the same process repeats. These kinds of algorithms are called genetic algorithms. 
Classic reinforcement learning algorithms are genetic or evolutional algorithms.

## Deep Learning

Deep learning however is just one area of machine learning, namely the one, which works with neural networks. Neural networks are a very comprehensive and complex topic.

##### Scikit-learn

It features classification, regression and clustering algorithms.

##### Tensorflow

It is a whole ecosystem for developing modern deep learning models. This means that it is mainly used for the development and training of models that use neural networks. It also has its own data structures and ways of visualizing data.

#### Modules to install

pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow

#### 1 Linear Regression

The easiest and most basic machine learning algorithm is linear regression.
It is a supervised learning algorithm. That means that we need both – inputs and outputs – to train the model.
The x-value is called the feature , whereas the y-value is our
label . The label is the result for our feature. Our linear regression model is represented by the blue line that goes straight through our data. It is placed so that it is as close as possible to all points at the same time. So we “trained” the line to fit the existing points or the existing data.










AI provide the capabilities to:
- Generalize/adapt
- Reason
- Solve problem

Types of ai:
* Weak AI - perform solely on one task
* Strong AI (exist fiction)
